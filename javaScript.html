Write the algorithim that would prompt a user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
The program should tell the user of the guess is too high or too low.
If the guess is correct, the program should alert how many guess the took.
 
1.Create a variable for the users answer, random number, number of guess, 
2.Promt the user to enter a number
3.Store a random number in a random variable
4.Loop until answer is correct
 `6.Test is answer is low - update user
7.Test if too high - update user
8.Alert if correct > yay
